We are slowly learning how to do smaller [bi-weekly releases](https://tuist.io/docs/contribution/release/#cadence). Everything went (almost) according to plan and Tuist 1.2.0 is here for you to enjoy!

## New contributors

Firstly, warm welcome to another first-time Tuist contributor [Maciej Piotrowski](https://github.com/paciej00) üëèüëèüëè. He improved the API introduced in the previous release for excluding files from a target. It makes exclude patterns more flexible which can be very useful when migrating an existing project to Tuist!

## TBD

TBD, maybe a few sentences about fixture generator?

## Website and Documentation

A new section was added to the website - [Best Practices](https://tuist.io/docs/usage/best-practices/). It is quite short at the moment, but will have a growing list of things that can be useful for both new Tuist users and developers trying to improve their setup. 

We also started using [`gatsby-remark-check-links`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-check-links/) which allows us to catch broken links on the website. On top of that we worked on SEO to improve the metadata so that Google would show richer search results.

## Full Changelog

There are also plenty of bugfixes and improvements in this release. The full changelog can as always be found on the [release page](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/releases/tag/1.2.0).
