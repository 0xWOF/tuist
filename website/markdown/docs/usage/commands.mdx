# Edit

One of the advantages of defining your projects in Swift is that we can leverage Xcode and the Swift compiler to safely edit the projects with syntax auto-completion and documentation.

Editing your projects is easy; position yourself in a directory where there's a project defined and run the following command:

```bash
tuist edit
```

It will open a temporary Xcode project with the manifests and the project description helpers. After making changes you can run the target from Xcode and it will call `tuist generate` for you.

The project is deleted automatically once you are done with editing. If you wish to generate and keep the project in the current directory, you can run the command passing the `--permanent` argument:

```bash
tuist edit --permanent
```

That will generate a `Manifest.xcodeproj` project that you can open manually.

# Scaffold

After project description helpers, `scaffold` is a next step to make it easier to create new modules in your app.
With `scaffold` you can define your own templates as well as use templates that Tuist provides to generate a basic structure of your module!

To use a built-in template called `default` (used for `tuist init`):
```bash
tuist scaffold default --attributes --name MyModule --platform ios
```

If you want to define your own template, we recommend you to run `tuist edit` - after that you can create a new directory `Tuist/Templates/name_of_your_template` where `Tuist/Templates` is a directory where all your custom templates will live. Additionaly you have to create a `Template.swift` in that directory:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let nameAttribute: Template.Attribute = .required("name")

let template = Template(
    description: "Custom template",
    attributes: [
        nameAttribute,
        .optional("platform", default: "ios"),
    ],
    files: [
        .static(path: "Project.swift",
                contents: "My template contents of name \(nameAttribute)"),
        .generated(path: "generated/Up.swift",
                   generateFilePath: "Generate.swift"),
    ],
    directories: ["generated"]
)
```

This template would then be called like this:
```bash
tuist scaffold name_of_template --attributes --name Name --platform macos
```

If you do not need any difficult logic, feel free to use `.static` for `files` parameter.
Otherwise, you can use a more powerful `.generated` file. You can define it in the same directory as `Template.swift`.

Such generated file then could look like this:

```swift
import ProjectDescription
import ProjectDescriptionHelpers

enum Platform: String {
    case iOS = "ios"
    case macOS = "macos"
}

enum PlatformError: Error, CustomStringConvertible {
    case invalidPlatform

    var description: String {
      return "Platform invalid. Platform should be either ios or macos!"
    }
}

let customContent = Content {
    guard let platform = Platform(rawValue: try getAttribute(for: "platform")) else { throw PlatformError.invalidPlatform }
    switch platform {
    case .iOS:
        return "This is iOS content"
    case .macOS:
        return "This is macOS content"
    }
}
```

You can see it's quite easy to access an attribute from user input using `getAttribute(for: "name_of_attribute")`

In this file we have created a switch statement for a given platform and generated a file with custom content for macOS and iOS and thrown an error when provided platform was not valid which is really powerful!

You can also leverage anything that you define in `ProjectDescriptionHelpers`, so you can share types and methods between your templates and manifests.

# Lint

One of the benefits of making the definition of projects explicit,
is that we can run checks on them and uncover configuration issues that otherwise would be bubbled up by the build system later on.
Tuist follows the principle of the sooner we detect the errors,
the less time developers will have to spend.
For that reason,
we provide a command that developers can run either locally or on CI to ensure their projects have a valid configuration:

```bash
tuist lint
```

Please note that there are checks that only the compiler and the build system can do.
In other words,
those will only be uncover by compiling the app with Xcode or `xcodebuild`.

# Graph

When projects grow, it becomes hard to visualize the dependencies between all the targets that are part of the project. Fortunately, Tuist provides a command, `tuist graph`, that loads your project dependencies graph and exports it in a representable format.

Being in a directory that contains a workspace or project manifest, run the following command:

```bash
tuist graph
```

The command will output a human-readable file, `graph.dot` that describes the dependencies graph using the [DOT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)>) description language.

## A visual representation of the graph

[Graphviz](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/graphviz) is a command line tool that take the `.dot` graph and convert it into an image.

```bash
brew install graphviz
dot -Tpng graph.dot > graph.png
```

Alternatively, you can use online services like [this one](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline) that renders your graph on a website.

# Up

Xcode projects often have dependencies with system tools like [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), or [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery). Those are dependencies that need to be installed/pulled and properly configured in the developer environment for the project to run.

Most projects include a list of steps in the `README` file for developers to follow:

```markup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Carthage if it's not already installed.
3. Install `brew install swiftlint`.
4. Run `carthage update`.
5. Open the project.
```

It’s a tedious process that can break without you noticing it. Moreover, each project usually has its own set of non-standard steps, which makes inconvenient jumping from one project to another.

The good news is that Tuist offers a command, **tuist up** that helps you define your project dependencies and then takes care of the configuration process for you.

To define your project dependencies, we need to create a new `Setup.swift` manifest file:

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let setup = Setup([
    .homebrew(packages: ["swiftlint"]),
    .carthage(platforms: [.iOS])
  ])
```

We have turned the markdown steps that we saw before into up commands in the setup manifest. When you run `tuist up`, Tuist translates those declarations into actual commands that are executed in your system.

Moreover, it assesses whether those dependencies are already met in the environment, and if they are, it skips them. For instance, if the Carthage dependencies exist and are up to date, it doesn’t run the Carthage update command.

```bash
tuist up
```

## Available commands

Tuist offers the following set of commands.

### Homebrew packages

```swift
.homebrew(packages: [“swiftlint”])
```

It installs the given [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) packages if they don’t exist in the system.

### Homebrew tap

```swift
.homebrewTap(repositories: ["peripheryapp/periphery"])
```

Configures Homebrew tap repositories. It also installs Homebrew if it's not available in the system.

### Carthage dependencies

```swift
.carthage(platforms: [.macOS])
```

It runs [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage) dependencies for those dependencies that don’t exist or that are outdated.

### Custom

```swift
.custom(name: "Name", meet: ["./install.sh"], isMet: ["test", "mytool"])
```

Besides the built-in commands, you can define yours using the custom option. It takes the following arguments:

- **Name:** Name of the command
- **Meet:** Command to run in the system to configure the environment.
- **Met:** Command to run in the system to verify whether the environment is already configure. A 0 exit code means that the environment is already configured.

If you have ideas of other built-in commands that Tuist could offer, don’t hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/tuist/tuist/issues/new) with your ideas.
