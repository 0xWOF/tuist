# Command Line Tools

On macOS we can build various command line tools (like tuist) this way you can define your project.

```swift
let project = Project(
    name: "CLITool",
    targets: [
        Target(
            name: "CLITool",
            platform: .macOS,
            product: .commandLineTool,
            bundleId: "io.tuist.App",
            infoPlist: .default,
            sources: ["Sources/**"],
        ),
    ]
)
```

Keep in mind that command line tools support only statically linked dependencies, Tuist will do its best to keep his eye on that.
