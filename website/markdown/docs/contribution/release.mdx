# Release

The process for releasing new versions of Tuist is described in the file `RELEASE.md`,
which is located in the root directory of the project.
Only maintainers from the [Core team](/docs/contribution/core-team/) have rights,
and are allowed to champion releases.

## Cadence

Tuist is released in a 2-week cadence because one week is too short as to have enough features to justify a release,
and more than 2 weeks might leave users waiting for bug fixes and improvements landing on the project.

We **might skip** the release train if there aren't enough changes to justify a release,
or if there aren't people available to champion it.
