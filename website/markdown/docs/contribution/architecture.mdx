## Architecture

The project is organized in several targets that are defined in the `Package.swift` manifest file:

![Diagram that represents the targets architecture](assets/architecture.png)

- **TuistKit:** It contains the commands and Tuist's business logic.
- **TuistEnvKit:** It contains the commands and the logic to manage multiple Tuist versions in the environment.
- **TuistLoader:** Contains models and utilities to load the manifest files from the disk.
- **TuistGenerator:** It contains all the business logic to read the project definition and generate Xcode projects.
- **TuistGalaxy:** It contains the business logic for Galaxy-specific features.
- **TuistAutomation:** It contains the business logic for automation command such as build, test, or lint.
- **TuistCore:** Contains the models that are specific to the Tuist domain and protocols to allow doing dependency inversion between the features in the layers above.
- **TuistSupport:** Contains support utilities and extensions that are share across the other targets. They are Tuist-agnostic.
- **ProjectManifest:** Contains the models that the developers can use to declare their projects in the `Project.swift` manifest file.
- **tuist:** It's the actual CLI that exposes the commands defined in `TuistKit`.
- **tuistenv:** It's the CLI of `tuistenv`. It exposes the commands defined in `TuistEnvKit`.

## Utilities

All generic utilities live in the `TuistSupport` framework. This section documents some of the utilities and how to use them.

### Printer

When printing output for the user, this is the utility that should be used over the global `print` method. The utility provides formatting that varies depending on the terminal the process is run from, and determines whether the standard output or error should be used based on the type of content being output.

The methods from the public interface take a `PrintableString` as an input. Printable strings support interpolating formatted strings. For instance, if we want to tell users they need to run a command, we can do the following:

```swift
Printer.shared.print("Please run the folling command to setup the environment: \(.command("tuist up"))")
```
