question: 'Can I generate the manifest files from my Xcode projects?'
---

While we can generate Xcode projects from your manifest files, doing it the other way around is not possible. It's possible to implement such feature in Tuist, but since we wouldn't be able to do it reliably considering how Xcode projects can be, we opted for not doing it. Moreover, going through the process of defining the manifests helps you spot issues in your current projects that otherwise would go unnoticed.
