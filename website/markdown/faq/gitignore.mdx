question: 'Should I gitignore my projects?'
---

This is really up to you. If you add the `.xcodeproj` and `.xcworkspace` files to your `.gitignore` file you'll save tons of painful git conflicts. Our recommendation is that you first migrate the project to Tuist, and once everything is up and running, educate the developers in your team on running `tuist generate` when they plan to work on a project. Once they build the habit, you should be able to `.gitignore` those projects with no impact at all.
