question: 'How does Tuist compare to the Swift Package Manager?'
---

Although there are similarities between both tool, the Swift Package Manager (SPM)'s main focus is on dependencies. With Tuist, instead of defining packages that SPM integrates into your projects, you define your projects using concepts with whom you are already familiar: _projects, workspaces, targets, and schemes._ If your project needs to define remote dependencies, Tuist supports defining [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage), and Swift packages.
