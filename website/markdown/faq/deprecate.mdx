question: 'What if the tool is deprecated at some point?'

There's nothing to worry about because if that happens you can just add the Xcode projects and workspaces to the git repository and problem solved. One of Tuist's designs principles is staying as close as possible to Xcode and industry standards. Generated projects have no dependency nor reference to Tuist whatsoever.
